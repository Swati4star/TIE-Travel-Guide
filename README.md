While travelling from one place to another, there are a lot of factors to be considered so as to make the trip a memorable one. Our product helps the traveller with anything and everything  that he might need from the moment he plans the journey till the time he is back home happy and content.
The product includes a wide variety of options- from Selection of Mode of Transport to finding out about the place of visit to provision of Best music,videos,novels depending on the mood of the traveller. Just as mentioned above, the product covers anything and everything.
Starting with the selection of Mode of Transportation, the user can choose from- By road, Bus, railways or airlines. After selection of the mode, we let him know the best options available for the chosen mode of transportation. For example, if the chosen mode is By Road, we let him know about the total toll taxes and the total cost of fuel he has to bear. For bus, train and plane, we let him know about the best options available in market and purchase the tickets from the app itself.
Next comes the Journey Phase. For this phase we have some exciting features which we’ve planned to include in our app.
The first among the many features  is  Exploring the Place of Visit  which the traveller is visiting probably for the first time- it allows the user to find out about the culture of the place, the best food outlets  in the place, most famous tourist spots he can visit, the best nightlife he can get there and even the best cultural places so that he has some souvenirs to share with his family and friends.
Next comes Lodging - If the traveller needs a place to live, we provide him with a good number of option of hotels and lodging facilities. A translator can be included to deal with communication problems the traveller might face at any point during his journey.
A very interesting feature that we plan to include in the product is - Push notification in between the journey. Often it happens that while travelling alone, a person tends to doze off. In order to save the traveller from missing out the destination station, we use the real time GPS location of the traveller to let him know about the city he is currently in or about to reach. We also plan to include an alarm notification which would go off when the traveller is around half an hour (calculated using the speed is travelling with) away from his destination so as to ensure the traveller doesn’t miss his destination. If interested, the traveller can take a little detour and explore this city as well. Just so that the traveller doesn’t get bored during his journey and to provide the maximum comfort possible, we provide the user with the best Music, Videos and stuff to read so that even if the person is travelling alone, he’s not practically alone. The Music, Videos and Reading material provided would depend on the tastes and the mood of the user which would be done using Mood Analysis with Machine Learning. For instance, if the user is feeling low, we can recommend him jokes or humorous videos. The UI of the app would also change according to user’s mood to make him comfortable.
While travelling, a person clicks a quite significant number of pictures. To make it easier for him to share these pictures on any of his social media accounts, we provide a feature that if he signs-in from his social media account and clicks a picture from our app, it will be directly uploaded on the respective account using some filters and along with some text.
We have tried to include solutions for every possible problem the traveller may face during the course of his entire journey.
